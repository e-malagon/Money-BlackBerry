# Money for BlackBerry®

For historical purposes an old version of our first Money project. It was developed for the BlackBerryOS® platform. Probably it can not be longer compilable because a BlackBerry® signing service is required.

Also, a keygen that was used by our support team to generate a key on the fly. As a joke, we used a pirate patch over the rollover icon.
